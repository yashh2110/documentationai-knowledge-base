## Writing Assistant and Smart Discovery

The Writing Assistant helps draft sections, suggest citations, and refine prose. Smart Discovery recommends related papers based on your library and queries.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="How Smart Discovery Works" default-open="true">
    Enter keywords or upload a draft. The AI scans your references and external sources to suggest 5-10 relevant papers with similarity scores.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Integration Example">
    Use the JavaScript SDK to embed discovery in your app.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
```javascript
import { Paperguide } from '@paperguide/sdk';

const client = new Paperguide({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
const recommendations = await client.discovery.search({
  query: 'machine learning ethics',
  limit: 10
});
console.log(recommendations);
```
```python
from paperguide import Paperguide

client = Paperguide(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
recommendations = client.discovery.search(
    query="machine learning ethics",
    limit=10
)
print(recommendations)
```
