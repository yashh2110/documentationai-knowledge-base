## Pro Tips

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Be Specific">
    Clear instructions lead to better results. Instead of "make it better," say "change the hero button color to #2563eb and increase padding to 20px."
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Reference Sections by Name">
    Help the AI locate content: "In the testimonials section..." or "The module with admin_label 'Hero CTA'..."
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Ask for Analysis First">
    Let the AI understand the page before editing. Start with "Analyze the structure of page ID [PAGE_ID]" before requesting changes.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Always Use Duplicates">
    Test major changes safely. Ask the AI to "create a duplicate first" before applying significant modifications.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Iterate in Small Steps">
    Break large changes into smaller, reviewable steps rather than one massive update.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Check the Audit Log">
    Review the Respira audit log in WordPress admin to confirm exactly what changed.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Use Module Admin Labels">
    For Divi and Elementor, set descriptive admin_label values to enable precise module targeting.

## FAQ

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Do these prompts work with Cursor, Claude, or both?">
    Yes. All prompts work with both Cursor and Claude Code, as long as Respira for WordPress is installed and connected via MCP.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="How specific should my prompts be?">
    More specific prompts lead to better results. Always mention the page ID, section name or admin_label, your goal, and the desired outcome.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Can I combine multiple changes in one prompt?">
    Yes. You can bundle related changes like editing text, adjusting design, and optimizing SEO in a single prompt. For unrelated changes, separate prompts work better.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="What if a prompt doesn't work as expected?">
    Visit the [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) page for guidance. Common fixes include being more specific, checking page IDs, and verifying your MCP connection.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="What's the difference between SEO and AEO?">
    SEO (Search Engine Optimization) focuses on ranking in traditional search results. AEO (AI Engine Optimization) focuses on being cited by AI assistants like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. Both are important for modern visibility.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Should I use page IDs or page names in prompts?">
    Page IDs are more reliable for precise targeting. Find your page ID in the WordPress URL when editing (e.g., post.php?post=**12345**&action=edit). Page names work for simple sites with unique titles.
  </Expandable>
